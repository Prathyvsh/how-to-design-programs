- [Merge Sort](http://htdp.org/2003-09-26/Book/curriculum-Z-H-33.html#node_thm_26.1.2) Good exercise in composing generative recursion.
- [Threshold Determination](http://htdp.org/2003-09-26/Book/curriculum-Z-H-33.html#node_thm_26.3.6) Neat exercise that gives a deeper look than what has been given so far on the performance of functions.
