1. What is a trivially solvable problem ?

To sort an empty array.

2. What is a corresponding solution ?

An empty array is already sorted.

3. How do we generate new problems that are more
easily solvable than the original problem? Is there one
new problem that we generate or are there several?

Divide the array in to two equal halves. One less than
the pivot and one greater than the pivot. There are several
new problems that we have to solve, but of the same nature.

4. Is the solution of the given problem the same as the
solution of (one of) the new problems? Or, do we need to
combine the solutions to create a solution for the original
problem? And, if so, do we need anything from the original
problem data?

Since the problem space has now been divided in to two,
we need to combine them after we have solved the individual ones.
The solution to these individual problems is same as the original one.
