1. What is a trivially solvable problem ?

To move the ball one step at a time.

2. What is a corresponding solution ?

Draw and clear the ball with a delay and then move the ball.

3. How do we generate new problems that are more
easily solvable than the original problem? Is there one
new problem that we generate or are there several?

Repeatedly draw the ball and move it.
There is only one new problem that we have to generate.

4. Is the solution of the given problem the same as the
solution of (one of) the new problems? Or, do we need to
combine the solutions to create a solution for the original
problem? And, if so, do we need anything from the original
problem data?

The solution is the same.
