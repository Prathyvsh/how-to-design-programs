We know that empty though empty is a legal list of symbols
(cons 'x empty) is a list of symbols where 'x is a legal symbol which fits the format (cons symbol list-of-symbol)
Since (cons 'y (cons 'x empty)) follows the above format where cons 'x empty has been shown to be a legal list of symbols, it follows that this pattern can be continued ad infinitum.

All the inventory items shown in the beginning of the chapter fits this pattern.
