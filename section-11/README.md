================
- [Apply-n to Move Picture](http://htdp.org/2003-09-26/Book/curriculum-Z-H-15.html#node_thm_11.2.3) Good exercise to think about how to chain functions.
- [Deep List](http://htdp.org/2003-09-26/Book/curriculum-Z-H-15.html#node_thm_11.2.4)
- [Integer Range](http://htdp.org/2003-09-26/Book/curriculum-Z-H-15.html#node_thm_11.3.4)
- [Red Balloons](http://htdp.org/2003-09-26/Book/curriculum-Z-H-15.html#node_thm_11.3.5) - Possibly the biggest exercise so far. Makes you think about your building blocks a bit harder.
