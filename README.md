Learning How to Design Programs
===============================

Answers to [HtDP](http://htdp.org/2003-09-26/Book/curriculum-Z-H-1.html) exercises.
Also includes open sourced metrics of textual reading and exercise solving times.

Conclusion:
-----------
The project took around 20 weeks to complete at a rate of around 4 pomodoros per day.
This means an output of 200-250 hours of work to complete the whole book.
And it's well worth it, if this is one of your first ventures into the land of
functional programming.

The toughest section personally was 12 where question 12.2.4 that felt like a bolt out of the blue
and made me re-evaluate my understanding of recursion learned thus far. There's so much
that single question made me re-assess. Apart from that all the questions marked in
each of the sections as interesting ones are worth doing and doing well. My attempts,
I feel could have been better and more concise if I had spent more time on them.

One of the crucial skills I gained by doing the exercise is to think a bit and sketch some solutions
down on paper before I started writing any code. I am sure this saved me considerable on contrast
with my previous approach which was to jump on the keyboard as soon as I finished reading the question.
A bit of thought on the question and it's implications goes a long way in giving you a head start.

I felt that this book had so much to teach and goes on to demonstrate the
strength of immutable data structures and recursion. Recommended from my side towards
any aspirant.
