[N Averages](http://htdp.org/2003-09-26/Book/curriculum-Z-H-53.html#node_thm_43.1.6) - Not a difficult exercise as the text suggests it to be but definitely worth doing for evaluating mutability vs immutability.
[Name of Cousins](http://htdp.org/2003-09-26/Book/curriculum-Z-H-53.html#node_thm_43.2.4) - Helps to build up understanding of circular references and extra practice on working with family trees.
[Sequence of Nodes](http://htdp.org/2003-09-26/Book/curriculum-Z-H-53.html#node_thm_43.2.10) - More hands on experience managing linked lists.
